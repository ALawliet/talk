### GraphQL

Talk ships with GraphiQL, a live data layer IDE. We strongly recommend using GraphiQL early and often as you work with all things queries, mutations and subscriptions!

* [Install Talk](install-source.html).
* Open http://localhost:3000/api/v1/graph/iql in your browser. (Note, your server an port may differ.)
